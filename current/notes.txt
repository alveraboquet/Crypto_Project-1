add in a 'if the coin value has gone up by a certain amount then sell' //didnt work very well
firstly add in crypto 

161 better with diff, 59 better with flat
need to check if the ones better with flat are better in pt 2 with flat


Ranke the different min maxs by the gain/min
ADD IN A SELL ORDER WHEN VALUE STARTS TO DROP
check daily change as the trend is taken from 100 sample, daily might show more realistic (especially live)

check = 14, 


value is greater than buy value, and value is 0.9 of difference to max value- didnt work

put a sell limit if its been over 3 days

detect price increase or decrease befor buying, up / down
